Welcome to Alex's Chess AI with No Machine Learning!


The AI currently has the following features:

The actual game of chess, however, should work near perfectly. You can play against a friend on it if you want.

Moves are made by clicking once on the piece you want to move and then once on the square you want to move to. 
Support for clicking and dragging is coming but has not been implemented yet.
Some moves are illegal, and the engine will not let you make them. This is intended.
All legal moves for any given piece are highlighted when you click on the piece.

A few things are still handled through your Python terminal, so keep an eye out for prompts when promoting pawns and at 
the start of the game. Simply type in things as the program requests. 
Several of your keys on your keyboard will also do things. Controls are listed at the start of each game. 

INSTALLING DEPENDENCIES:

1. `# apt install python3 pip`

2. `# pip install pygame`

Contact me at the email address listed on my profile if you have any questions.

How to run the program:

`$ python Engine.py` 
(A black window should appear if everything has been installed correctly)

Pay attention to your terminal, the program will prompt you for everything else from here!

Controls:

- Z: undo move
- spacebar: flip board to view from the other color's perspective
- L: start/stop music
- M: cycle music track
- V: cycle volume
- P: pause/play music
- C: copy board position to text file
- V: load board position from save


The program should run and play some hopefully not terrible chess. Feel free to grab a friend to play a game against, or to see if they can beat the AI.
The AI will also play against itself if you set both players to be AI.
